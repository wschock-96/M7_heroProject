# Marvel Character App

This full-stack Marvel Character App allows users to create, view, edit, and delete superhero and villain profiles. Built using Flask for the backend and React for the frontend, the application connects to a MySQL database and delivers a responsive, bootstrap-styled interface. Each character has detailed attributes including name, alias, alignment, powers, and an image URL. The API is fully RESTful and integrated with React via Axios for seamless interaction.

The app features a clean navigation experience using React Router, with distinct pages for character listings, individual character detail, creation, editing, and a 404 fallback. All forms are built with React Bootstrap and include live validation and feedback. When a user submits a form, the data is validated and then posted to the backend, which stores it securely in the database. The frontend dynamically updates to reflect changes, making the user experience feel instant and interactive.

From a design perspective, the application uses a Marvel-themed red, black, and white color scheme and is fully responsive for mobile and desktop use. Cards and buttons are styled for clarity and ease of use, and toast or alert messages provide instant visual feedback. This project showcases the integration of Python with modern JavaScript frameworks and follows best practices in state management, routing, and user feedback for a polished development experience. Thank you.



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
